## Project Overview

This interactive dashboard visualizes microbial biodiversity in human belly buttons using data from a public science outreach project by [NC State University](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/). Each test subject‚Äôs microbial profile is represented through dynamic charts built with JavaScript, D3.js, and Plotly.

The project blends science communication with code, making complex biological data accessible and engaging. Users can explore the diversity of bacterial species (OTUs) found in individuals‚Äô navels, and even see how frequently they wash.

## Features

- Dynamic dropdown menu to toggle between individual test subjects  
- Bar chart of the top 10 OTUs per subject  
- Bubble chart showing OTU distribution and abundance  
- Gauge chart displaying belly button washing frequency  
- Responsive layout with Bootstrap  

## Tools & Technologies

- JavaScript  
- Plotly.js  
- D3.js  
- HTML / CSS  
- Bootstrap  

## Usage

Use the live site [here](https://johbry17.github.io/Belly-Button-Dashboard/).  
Select a test subject from the dropdown menu to update all visualizations accordingly.
